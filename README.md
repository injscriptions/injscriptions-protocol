# Overview

&#x20;      Injscriptions is a simple, efficient, and cost-effective method for issuing and circulating digital assets on the Injective Chain. The issuance and transfer of assets will be engraved in the Memo field of ordinary transfer transactions on the Injective Chain, resulting in a significant reduction in the cost of asset circulation by an order of magnitude, while maintaining security on par with or even higher than smart contracts.

### Memo Feature in Injective:

* **Optional Message:**    Memo is an optional field in an injective transaction. Generally used as a note for users to send transactions. The content of Memo is included in the signature of the transaction, making the content of  Memo protected by all blockchain system.&#x20;
* **Informational Purposes:** Users often utilize the memo field to add context or information related to the transaction, such as a description of the purpose of the transaction. It can also be used to tag different types of transactions in the transaction history.
* **Length Limit:** Currently, Injective limits the length of the Memo field to 256 bytes. It has good support for the inscription protocol and also prevents resource abuse.



### **Advantages**&#x20;

* **Cost-Efficiency**:  They are different from the state changes and logic checks that accompany on-chain data when smart contracts are triggered, so they consume an order of magnitude less Gas than CW20 transactions, requiring only about 100K Gas.
* **Security**:  Memos are text.  the same security model as the base blockchain.
* **Simplicity**:  Inscription only defines a few operations such as Deloy, Mint, and Transfer. There is no efficient and complex logical processing and it is safe.
